# A visualizer for Min Heap Binary Trees

<small>From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap):</small>

A binary heap is a heap data structure created using a binary tree. It can be seen as a binary tree with two additional constraints:

* **Shape property**
A binary heap is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.

* **Heap property**
All nodes are less than or equal to each of their children.

## Use

The Min Heap Binary Tree Visualizer can be found at this repository's [Pages URL](http://brettdewoody.github.io/binary-heap-visualizer/).

Enter a value in the input field in the top right and click the _Push_ button to push the value to the min heap binary tree.

Click the _Pop_ button to pop the lowest value.
